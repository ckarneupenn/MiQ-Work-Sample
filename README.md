# MiQ-Work-Sample - CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS REPORT ANALYZED AND PREPARED BY ME FOR A MAJOR CLIENT DURING MY INTERNSHIP AT MIQ DIGITAL INDIA PVT LTD.

While I was interning at MiQ Digital India Pvt Ltd, I was assigned to prepare a pre - campaign analysis report for one of their major clients (A1+ level client). This client is a well known popular Hotel Brand that is present all over the world.

### Problem Statement: 
The client wanted to expand their business into the CALA (Caribbean & Latin America) countries but was facing some issues and wanted to know the reasons for it, and also the characteristics of the customers who travel to and book hotels in the CALA region.

### Our Approach: 
We set out to understand who the core customer is as well as identify the various key behaviors that define these audiences. Through a defined strategy, we performed a search pattern analysis of users booking hotels and flights from US to CALA and US to CALA to CALA and identified key behaviors. This allowed us to hone in on core audiences and activate different strategies against them. We took one of the most popular website which is used all over the US to book hotels and flight tickets and gathered all the URLs of pages where customers were booking hotels and flights in the CALA region from the US. We then scraped all these URLs using R Programming to form an initial dataset, then cleaned it, and then started our analysis. We wrote some highly optimized SQL and Hive queries to derive insights, used R and Python to play around with the data to find more insights. Advanced Excel (Pivot Tables and other advanced functions and formulas) was useful to derive geo insights. All the insights derived were structured and presented in Microsoft PowerPoint like a story to the client.

### Analysis Performed: 
Audience Analysis, Top Destinations, Temporal Analysis, Temperature Analysis, Traveler Characteristics, Online Search Behavior, Destinations Correlated With Temperature, Various Geo Analyses.
